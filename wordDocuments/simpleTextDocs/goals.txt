working on chapter 2, ui hand model 	
	-	work hard. 
		- good job. you worked hard. keep working hard. it will all pay off ^^
		- took way too long break from 9:20-11:20. 
		- good job. started workign hard again. recite for encouragement. 
		- 
	'	
	
	- fix spelling and code samples. --done
	- fix figure names and referencing. --done
	
	
	
	- write one sentence at a time. think about what the sentence should be. write out what you should be expressing (as if you are trying to explain it to a friend). seeing this in words will make it more concrete and help you write what you need to. 
	- think about what questions you are trying to answer. write them in the paragraph to help you begin
	
	- can take out driving questions later. 

	
	
	
	
	- 	snchronized. platform.runlater. print statements to determine which methods actually run. 		
	- why is synchronized important. what does it mean in the program. 
	- what is run later? is it a thread? does it start multiple threads? 
	- explain how the program is running several threads in conjuction. 
	- for example, the one listening on user input, the one processing data from lm
	

	
	-	update bibliography on overleaf.

%----------------------------------- Limitations of Sensor and Documentation (put this when talking about rotation and coordinate systems chapter)
\subsection{Limitations of Sensor and Documentation}
--occulusion
--discontinuation of publishing v2 apps
--sensor resetting by opening palm
--not enough documentation for linux/ubuntu. 
--talk about the right handed coordinate system of leap motion. (do this in the section on coordinate systems)




------Appendix A:
setting up project in intellij ide. 
--discuss how to set the library path for compiling and running jar. and program. 
talk about sdk and how its different from just installing leap motion. <- runs a process. etc. to be able to receive info from that process we need 
native lib. 
--read the page on lm website and summarize
