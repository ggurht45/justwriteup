Leap Motion
    1. What is leap motion. How does it work? Does it use infrared? What is its coordinate system? 
	Does it allow for multiple languages? Does it have an api? Is it still relevant today?
    2. Demonstration of a simple app using leap motion. What is inside the frame object? What is a hand object? 
	How is info stored inside it? Is it ui or just raw info. 
    3. Native libraries. What does that mean? How is that setup in intellij ide
    4. Limitations: occlusion. Not so sensitive. Documentation is a little dated. Not much support for linux. 

(1)Leap Motion controller is a small infrared-enabled sensor that can be attached to one’s computer via a USB cable. It is manufactured and programmed by Leap Motion Inc, US based company located in San Francisco. It comes with its own software that allows it to detect a user’s hand movements in 3D space without any physical touch. The Leap Motion controller accomplishes this via
