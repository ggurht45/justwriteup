% should talk about how it can be made better. maybe can weigh different fingers differently. maybe in certain gestures a certain finger is more imprortant.

	-angle, dont die if left/right. 
	-need to have a way of returning 0 if one of the fingers is compeletley off. 
	-need to be able to parameterize by finger level. (compare2). if in gesture10 we expect the pinky to be a little curved, should be able to set that parameter on that pinky in that gesture. rather than entire algorithm. need more fine tune parameterization.

using goals is very helpful. 
break down of tasks. 

functional programming is so much better. 

learning things on the run. stackoverflow. learning to debug.

github. branches. going back in history. 
 
latex.
