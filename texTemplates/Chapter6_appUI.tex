In this chapter some of the useful UI features of the application will be discussed.

\section{Main Layout}

The application has three main scenes. One is the home screen which shows buttons to take the user to the other two scenes. It also contains two radio buttons to allow the user to select which hand (left or right) he/she will be testing with the gestures. Figure  \ref{fig:homescreen} shows the layout of the home screen.
