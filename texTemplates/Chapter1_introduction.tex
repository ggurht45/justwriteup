%Computer science as a field is growing rapidly and expanding into many other disciplines including health care. This project is about very

\section{Motivation}
Apraxia comes from the prefix “a” meaning “without” and the  Greek root word “praxis” which means “action”. Apraxia is a neurological condition that is sometimes caused by the effects of a stroke. It is a condition in which the patient is unable to exercise motor control over some of their muscles. The muscles themselves are not paralyzed or damaged, what causes these disorders are neurological conditions. In the department of Experimental Psychology researchers are studying patients with post-stroke loss of motor skills including possible cases of apraxia. The diagnosis of such a condition involves researchers presenting their patients with different movement based tests and evaluating the ease and effectiveness with which the patients are able to complete these screenings.

\section{Goals}
%what were the goals of this project and application. 

provide a application that clinicians can use to collect hand gesture data from patients. 
this data should be able to be scored by algorithms to determine how close their attempts are.
there will be two main functions of comparison that will be developed. 
the data collected should be able to be viewed inside the application
the data should be editable from within the app.
stored and retrieved from. 
the data should be saved to csv and outside data should be able to be loaded into the app by csv(as long as hand data is there)
the application should be easy for the users. it should not require a set position of their hand or wrist. 
the gestures shown should be rotateable. to allow from viewing from different angles.
