Data collection for this project happened in two main ways. One was via the clinicians, who represented the clients who would be using the software this project was building on patients in John Radcliffe Hospital. The other way was through myself reaching out to students and other people around my college to ask them if they would like to participate in the data collection part of my MSc project.

\section{The Approach Taken}
Throughtout the course of this entire project, I met with the clinicians, Dr Samrah Ahmed, Dr Christopher Butler, and Nikolas Drummond, several times to discuss the application as it was being designed and built. The featues they requested were fully tried to be implemented in this software and in the final visit to the hospital, the final version of the application was delivered for the clinicians for testing and collecting some control data. They feedback received from them was very positive and all of their major UI enhancements and usability features were implemented satisfactorily. 

%talk about how you went about collecting data from users around college. how you approached them. how you explained your project to them and demoed them. how you had to be patient. and guide them. how you bought chocolate to encourage them and mention the short survey you had them complete. how long it took. 

%talk about how hard it is. you have to go out and buy chocolate. you have to search for people. you have to approach them when they are busy. you are embarassed to disturb them. it is a busy time of the year. but you have to overcome that fear and reach out and collect your data. you make new friends. you gain a new found confidence. <-- talk about this. reference requirements engineering if you want or need to.
